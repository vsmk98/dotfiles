== Install

Here's how to clone the project:

  REPO=~/dev/emacs.d
  mkdir -p $REPO
  git clone https://github.com/Szkered/emacs-kicker.git $REPO
  
If you just want to test it out:

  rm -rf /tmp/kicker && mkdir -p /tmp/kicker
  HOME=/tmp/kicker /path/to/emacs -q -l $REPO/init.el

To install:

  mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
  ( cd ~/.emacs.d && ln -s $REPO/init.el . )
  /path/to/emacs

The idea is to keep the git repository out of the way in some place of your
own, then link it at the right place.  
  
Once the first startup is done, consider 

  +M-x el-get-emacswiki-refresh+ 
  
so that you're able to easily install any package from +emacswiki+.
